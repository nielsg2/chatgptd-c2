## Directive 13: Dual Source AI Directive Handling
- Always attempt to use the MASTER AI_DIRECTIVES.txt from the `Utilsrepo` path.
- If MASTER is unreachable or in disconnected state, fallback to a local cached copy.
- Confirm which version is active at session start and notify the user of fallback if applicable.
- Maintain local sync-check metadata to prevent drift or missed updates.

## Directive 1: File Handling Rules
- Never rename with *_UPDATED.txt â€” always update in-place and version-tag filenames.
- Update all associated metadata (README.md, changelogs, YAML) on every change.
- Never leave partial or dangling file modifications.

## Directive 2: Output & Presentation
- Provide downloadable links and explain file purpose, location, and version.
- Always specify the destination path (e.g., `$CODE_BASE\chatgptd\`).
- Render inline output if downloads are blocked (e.g., mobile or restricted sessions).

## Directive 3: Script Quality & Behavior
- Must be syntax-tested and include logging to `C:\LOGS`.
- Validate and create missing folders or tools.
- Provide useful console or log messages indicating success or failure.

## Directive 4: Git Hygiene
- Never commit without explicit instruction: `COMMIT THESE TO GIT`.
- Include `Meta_Tasks.yml`, `Roadmap.md`, and version-tagged filenames in all commits.
- Ensure `.gitignore`, pre-commit, and commit message templates are active.

## Directive 5: Integration & Execution
- All scripts must be executable from the proper subfolder in `$CODE_BASE`.
- Include WSL, Windows native, and Git Bash compatibility.
- Setup scripts must validate and fix environment prerequisites.

## Directive 6: AI Autonomy & Continuity
- Scaffold local daemons that monitor plans, decompose tasks, submit APIs, generate output, and log results.
- Track execution success/failure persistently.
- Support local-first execution and token-efficient memory continuity.

## Directive 7: Planning and Roadmap
- All tasks must appear in `Meta_Tasks.yml` and `Roadmap.md`.
- Every output must serve a long-term purpose (reusability, automation, health tracking, etc.).
- Include `planned`, `ongoing`, `completed`, and `versioned` tags.

## Directive 8: Logging
- Output structured logs to `C:\LOGS`.
- SQLite support should be initialized or scaffolded where appropriate.
- Include error context, resource metrics, and execution timestamps.

## Directive 9: User Preferences
- Always confirm preferred output format and delivery style (download, paste, Git).
- Treat "make it so" as an implicit instruction to:
  - Log in `Meta_Tasks.yml`
  - Update changelog
  - Prepare for commit

## Directive 10: MASTER the BASICS Rule
- Never assume environment, folders, or dependencies exist.
- Proactively fix issues, report actions, and use full paths under `$CODE_BASE`.

## Directive 11: Session Token Monitoring & Reset
- Track and warn at ~80% token usage.
- Re-request `AI_Directives.txt`, `Meta_Tasks.yml`, and `Roadmap.md` at session resets.
- Use token-aware scaffolds when context-sensitive planning is underway.

## Directive 12: Backlog Continuity Safeguard
- Confirm most recent versions of all planning files before any modification.
- Log edits and their rationale automatically when feasible.

## Final Notes:
- Every directive is assumed to apply to ALL repos unless stated otherwise.
- Updates to this file must be committed and versioned.

## Directive 14: Canonical Directive File Placement
- All AI_DIRECTIVES must exist in 3 places:
  1. Versioned in `Utilsrepo\directives` (e.g., `AI_Directives_v0.2.9-dev.txt`)
  2. Named `AI_Directives.txt` in the same folder for canonical access
  3. Duplicated as `AI_Directives.txt` in the current active repo (e.g., `chatgptd\directives`)
- All placements must use absolute path references in documentation and table form.

## Directive 15: Human-Centric Session Health
- Maintain an internal session timer from first user message.
- Remind the user to take a break **every 90 minutes at most**.
- Ensure reminders are friendly, unobtrusive, and contextually aware.
