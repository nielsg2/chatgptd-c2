# ðŸ§© SESSIONFRAG: chatgptd Architecture Planning

This session established a strategic roadmap for the `chatgptd` project. Niels proposed a modular breakdown to support a full local-first AI orchestration system that can interact with ChatGPT's API while maintaining privacy, memory, and state continuity across sessions.

## Key Outcomes
- Defined 8 modules (Memory, AI Bridge, Task Manager, UX UI, Local Agent, REST API, Logger, File Ingestor)
- Enforced Zero Trust and local storage goals
- Rejected Supabase-style cloud reliance
- UX planned via local web/electron interface
- Future expansion scoped into FastAPI gateway

This roadmap aligns with broader LifePlan and Utilsrepo infrastructure. Next action: begin scaffolding key modules and committing directory structure.
