14.5. Counter Notification. If you receive a notification from deal.ai that material made available by you on or through the Service has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide deal.ai with what is called a "Counter Notification".

14.7. False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: "[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [deal.ai] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it." deal.ai reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.

19. Limitation of Liability

19.1. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE DEAL.AI ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY DEAL.AI ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

19.3. EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS.

THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 19 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

20. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

20.1. Generally. Except as described in Section 20.2 (Exceptions) and 20.3 (Opt-Out), you and deal.ai agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms, the Service, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND DEAL.AI ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

20.2. Exceptions. Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

20.3. Opt-Out. If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 20 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) within 30 days after the date that you agree to these Terms by sending a letter to Deal.ai Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 1065 SW 8th St PMB 5360 Miami, FL 33130 that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration ("Opt-Out Notice"). Once deal.ai receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 20 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 21.2 (Governing Law). The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.

20.4. Arbitrator. This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, "AAA Rules") as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting deal.ai.

20.5. Commencing Arbitration. Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice of Arbitration"). deal.ai's address for Notice is: Deal.ai Inc., 1065 SW 8th St PMB 5360 Miami, FL 33130. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or deal.ai may commence an arbitration proceeding. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, deal.ai will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if deal.ai has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.

20.6. Arbitration Proceedings. Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of your billing address unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or deal.ai must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.

20.7. Arbitration Relief. Except as provided in Section 20.8 (No Class Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by deal.ai before an arbitrator was selected, deal.ai will pay to you the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator's award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator's application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

20.8. No Class Actions. YOU AND DEAL.AI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and deal.ai agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

20.9. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If deal.ai makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to deal.ai's address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case your account with deal.ai will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.

20.10. Enforceability. If Section 20.8 (No Class Actions) or the entirety of this Section 20 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) is found to be unenforceable, or if deal.ai receives an Opt-Out Notice from you, then the entirety of this Section 20 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 21.2 (Governing Law) will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

Use of Section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word "including" means "including but not limited to." If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

21.2. Governing Law. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida without regard to conflict of law principles.
