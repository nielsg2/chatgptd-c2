# ⏳ Session Log — July 13, 2025 @ 01:14 UTC

## 🧠 Key Actions Completed:
- Logged session memory append request and processed update
- Uploaded prior memory log and canonical template
- Carried forward pending tasks into new memory state
- Declared next-session plan for roadmap consolidation and GitOps automation

## 🖥️ Commands Issued:
```powershell
# No new shell commands issued — all actions processed through memory handling and file upload
```

## 🔧 Files Used:
- `session_log_2025-07-13T01-10Z.md`
- `session_memory_template.md`
- `chatgptd-c2/session_memory/` as logging target

## 📍 Next Check After Reboot / Session:
- Confirm roadmap scan automation begins cleanly
- Verify `session_memory/MASTER_Roadmap.md` is generated
- Ensure proper GitOps sequence is followed (add → commit → push)

## 💬 Pending/Left Open:
- Integration into `CoreOps.db` log system
- Reload directives from `AI_DIRECTIVES.txt`
- Resume from current backlog or `command.json` trigger
- Begin roadmap consolidation task across all repos (scan, merge, commit MASTER_Roadmap.md)

## 🧠 Directives Loaded:
- All session memory logs must follow canonical template
- `.ps1` scripts reside in `Utilsrepo\Scripts`
- All logs must include resume block, commands, and SHA256 (post-commit)
- Roadmap consolidation will be handled via AI-driven GitOps on next run

## 🔄 Resume Instructions:
- Reload `AI_DIRECTIVES.txt` and scan for deltas
- Begin full scan of `$CODE_BASE` for all `Roadmap.md` and `Meta_Tasks.yml` files
- Merge into `MASTER_Roadmap.md` under session_memory
- Commit and push for remote agent visibility
